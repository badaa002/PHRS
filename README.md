# Personalized Health Recommendation System

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

The Personalized Health Recommendation System is an AI-based solution that generates customized health advice for users. By analyzing user data such as age, fitness goals, and activity levels, it provides personalized recommendations on exercise, nutrition, and lifestyle changes. This system aims to help individuals improve their overall well-being with tailored advice.

## Background

Many people struggle to find health recommendations that are truly relevant to them. Most health tips are one-size-fits-all, which makes it hard for people to achieve their personal fitness or health goals. This project solves the following problems:

* **Generic advice:** Most health tips don't account for individual needs.
* **Motivation:** Personalized guidance helps users stay motivated and committed to their goals.
* **Confusion:** People often don't know which exercise or diet is best for them.

This system is important because it helps users get the health advice that fits their personal needs, making it easier for them to improve their health. 

### Problems it solves:
* Providing personalized exercise plans based on individual goals and health data.
* Offering tailored nutrition tips for a balanced diet.
* Suggesting lifestyle changes that align with the user's preferences and health condition.

## How is it used?

The system works by having users input basic personal information, such as their age, gender, activity level, and health goals. Based on this data, the system generates specific recommendations. Here's how users can use the system:

1. **Input data:** Users fill out a questionnaire with details about their health and fitness goals.
2. **Receive recommendations:** The system processes this data to generate a personalized health plan.
3. **Follow suggestions:** The system suggests customized workouts, diet plans, and wellness tips.

### Who are the users?
- **Individuals looking to improve fitness:** Custom workouts and diet plans for weight loss, muscle gain, or overall health.
- **People with specific health needs:** Customized advice for managing conditions like diabetes, heart disease, etc.
- **Fitness enthusiasts:** Those who want to optimize their performance or try new routines.

Example of how the recommendation system works:
```python
def generate_recommendations(user_data):
    recommendations = []
    
    # Example of personalized exercise advice
    if user_data["activity_level"] == "sedentary":
        recommendations.append("Try starting with daily 30-minute walks.")
    elif user_data["activity_level"] == "active":
        recommendations.append("Incorporate strength training 3 times a week.")
    
    # Example of nutrition advice
    if user_data["goal"] == "weight_loss":
        recommendations.append("Increase protein intake and reduce carbs.")
    else:
        recommendations.append("Focus on a balanced diet with more vegetables.")
    
    return recommendations


## Data sources and AI methods

The system uses health and fitness data from publicly available datasets to provide personalized advice. Some of the data sources include:

- **Health and wellness data**: Information on general health conditions, exercises, and nutrition tips.
- **Exercise database**: A collection of exercises with detailed descriptions and benefits.

### AI Methods:

The system uses machine learning to analyze and recommend personalized advice. Some key methods include:

- **Classification**: Categorizing users based on their health goals and activity levels.
- **Recommendation Systems**: Predicting the best exercise, diet, and wellness recommendations based on user input.

| Method             | Description |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| Classification     | Categorizing users based on their health goals (e.g., weight loss, fitness, etc.) |
| Regression         | Predicting health outcomes based on user data (e.g., weight change, fitness improvement) |

### Example of how data is processed:

The system processes data like age, gender, and activity level to generate appropriate health advice.

## Challenges

Although the system provides personalized recommendations, there are some things it doesn't do:

- **Medical diagnoses**: It doesn't replace professional medical advice.
- **Real-time tracking**: It doesn't yet integrate with wearables or health monitoring devices for real-time data.

### Ethical considerations:

- **Data Privacy**: The system collects sensitive health data, which must be stored securely to protect user privacy.
- **Accuracy of Advice**: Recommendations are based on general health principles, but they should not replace advice from healthcare professionals.

## What next?

The project can grow in the following ways:

- **Mobile App**: A mobile version of the system for better accessibility.
- **Integration with wearables**: Connect with devices like smartwatches to provide real-time personalized recommendations based on live data.
- **Machine learning improvement**: The recommendation algorithm can be improved with more data and more sophisticated AI techniques.

### Skills and assistance needed:

To further develop the project, I would need help with:

- **Mobile app development** for wider user access.
- **Expert advice from healthcare professionals** to ensure the accuracy of recommendations.
- **Collaborators with machine learning expertise** to refine the AI model.
